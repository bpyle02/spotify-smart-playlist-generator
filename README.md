# Spotify Smart Playlist Generator
---
This is a simple Python program that prompts the user to enter a search query for a playlist. The program ranks songs from playlists based on this search query and creates a user playlist from those rankings. This allows the user to search for, say, a genre of music such as alternative rock, and generate a playlist from playlists with similar titles to the user's search query.
